/**
 * Manages a local pool of songs with intelligent shuffling and selection
 * 
 * This class implements a smart song pool management system that:
 * - Fetches songs from Spotify using the getUsersSavedTracks API
 * - Maintains separate pools for available and played songs
 * - Implements intelligent refresh strategies based on time and usage
 * - Prevents repetition through history tracking and exclusion
 * - Provides fallback mechanisms for robust operation
 * 
 * The pool refresh strategy:
 * - Refreshes every 30 minutes (configurable)
 * - Refreshes when 20+ songs have been played from current pool
 * - Uses random offsets to ensure variety across refreshes
 * - Implements rate limiting to prevent API abuse
 * 
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const pool = new SongPoolManager(spotifyAgent);
 * const songs = await pool.getNextSongs(4, ['track_id1', 'track_id2']);
 * const stats = pool.getPoolStats();
 * ```
